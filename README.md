<b>Dominex</b> is an application that replicates the real-world drug development cycle, right from the drug discovery phase to FDA approval and safety monitoring. It is a report generation application where, at every stage, there is proper monitoring of data and status visibility.

## Purpose
---
It’s hard for a big team of researchers working on a pharmaceutical drug to track their research progress in terms of different stages and get quality feedback from these stages.

<i>Our application works as a solution for this problem.</i>
